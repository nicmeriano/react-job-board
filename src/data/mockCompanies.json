MedWatcher allows users to submit adverse event reports to the FDA using a streamlined form while providing them with real-time notifications of government safety alerts, reported adverse events, news and research, and social media activity for specified products. Endorsed and co-branded by the FDA, MedWatcher currently covers all US drugs, devices, and vaccines, with expansion into the EU in progress. \n \n<p>Half of all Americans take a prescription drug, yet 86% of adverse drug events go unreported, according to HHS, with most reports coming from manufacturers. Reports that do get submitted are processed by the FDA and made public on an irregular basis -- monthly, quarterly, or sometimes even less frequently. This information system is slow, resulting in many missed safety signals, and puts patients at risk.</p>\n \n<p>MedWatcher tackles this issue by making it vastly easier to report adverse events and by sharing adverse event data immediately with patient and provider communities. With direct involvement from patients, a high volume of data, and a user-friendly, transparent system, MedWatcher is a powerful tool for making drugs, devices, and vaccines safer.</p>",
